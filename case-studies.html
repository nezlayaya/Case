                    <h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
                    <p>The quest for oil and gas companies to gain greater insight and control over their Drilling and
                        Well Operations is never ending. Mistakenly it is often concluded that by improving the
                        operational time, the ef ciency and cost will also be reduced.
                        Wells are different and comparing the operational performance at a certain point of time one by
                        one may not enclose the actual time thieves. Since the NPT reporting may vary between teams and
                        companies, the time data does not give completely accurate overview in this case either.
                        So how to identify the long-term trends of operational activity and improve performance ef
                        ciency?
                    </p>
                    <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
                    <p>TIME module in AGR’s iQxTM software platform uses up-to-the-minute data from the user’s daily
                        drilling report system and historic activity reports, enabling oil and gas companies to
                        accurately benchmark operational activity against both their own previous projects as well as
                        third party activity.
                        The data in iQxTM is automatically synchronised with all industry recognised drilling reporting
                        systems and publicly available data enabling to highlight the inef ciencies and opportunities
                        for cost and ef ciency improvement.
                    </p>
                    <h2>ADDED VALUE</h2>
                    <p>Since iQxTM TIME has the functionality to visualise data saved in any format, the engineers save
                        a lot of time normally spent on manual data search and processing. Additionally, the human error
                        factor is practically eliminated, which leads to a higher and more consistent level of quality
                        in the engineering.
                        iQxTM TIME enables quick generation of time/KPI data improving the ef ciency optimisation.

                    <p>
                        Figure 1 displays 20,000 non-standardised activity dots displaying operational activity data
                        registered in 36 wells at a certain depth point - through automatisation, TIME recognises similar
                        recorded activities by grouping them and enabling the software user to spend time on analysing
                        results rather than decoding and manually transferring data.
                        The case project in question used ”Flat Spot” analysis to unlock low productivity. Figure 2 shows
                        the time spent on 36 wells during ” at spot” phase (injection of production casing) on four drilling
                        units. In Figure 3 overleaf it can be seen that all units used similar amount of time on drilling
                        (highlighted with violet)..

                    <p>
                        Scrutinising deeper into the activity report it can be concluded thatthe difference in operational
                        time is caused by RCOH (the violet colour in Figure 2 highlighting running casing in open hole).
                        The difference can have been a result of poor cleaning of the hole or incorrect mud parametres were
                        secured prior to running the casing.
